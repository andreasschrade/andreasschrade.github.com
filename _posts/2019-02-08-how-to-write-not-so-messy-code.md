## It's a marathon, not a sprint

As a software developer, how much time do you spend with debugging and fixing bugs every day? Probably more than you want? The source of the problem is, that in many projects.... software developers face tight timelines. The CEO, a manager, or whoever came to the conclusion that it would make sense to ship a new product, a new release, some cool new feautures as soon as possible without really(!) asking the team which is responsible for making this new fancy thing happen. The result is... developers feel stressed, they begin to rush... and the result is, messy and buggy code.
