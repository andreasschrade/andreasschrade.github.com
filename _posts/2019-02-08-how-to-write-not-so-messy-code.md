## It's a marathon, not a sprint!

As a software developer, how much time do you spend with debugging and fixing bugs every day? Probably more than you want. 

A good software developers writes code carefully. He tries to catch possible problems early on.
It doesn't take so much longer to double-check the written code and to make sure that it doesnt contain a typicall error like:
wrong condition in branching or loop expression/statements
possible null pointer references
memory leaks
missing or insufficient tests
