I am a <strong>freelance Android Developer</strong> with over ten years of software development experience and an interest and strong background in Android and Java backend development. Former backend developer at one of Europe's largest electronic retailers and developer of an award-winning App. I like to share my knowledge by writing blog posts and articles for journals. 

I am looking for the next challenge. Any idea to discuss?
