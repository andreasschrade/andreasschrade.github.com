<h2>EN</h2>
I am a <strong>freelance Software Developer</strong> with over ten years of software development experience and an interest and strong background in Android and Java backend development. I am also interested in A.I., Deep Learning and smart technology.
I have a passion for performant, robust and flexible applications.
Former backend developer at one of Europe's largest electronic retailers and developer of an award-winning App. I like to share my knowledge by writing blog posts and articles for journals.

I am looking for the next challenge. Any idea to discuss?
